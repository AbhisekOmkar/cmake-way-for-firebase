# CMake Way for Firebase
## the daring adventures of popsicle runner

This is a sample project to be used with the CMake Way for Android codelab debuted at the Firebase Virtual Summit 2020. This branch contains the starter project, and feature/complete contains the final project.

## How to Build
This game is derived from Cocos2dx. Individual platform-specific build files are available under `proj.{platform_name}`. This was built and tested on Android, so opening `proj.android` in Android Studio is recommended. Developers with the cocos CLI may also run `cocos run -p android` to build and run the game.
